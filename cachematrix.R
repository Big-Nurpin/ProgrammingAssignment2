## A pair of functions that compute and cache the inverse
## of a matrix to save processing power on already
# calculated values

## Computes and caches the inverse of a matrix in a matrix-like object

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Computes the above function, if already calculates, retrieves from cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {

}
